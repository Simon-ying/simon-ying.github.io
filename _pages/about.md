I'm now a master student majoring in Electronic Engineering at the SJTU Paris Elite Institute of Technology (SPEIT) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research advisor is [Prof. Hao Li](https://speit.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/team-112.html). My current research is focused on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Moving Object Tracking (SLAMMOT), 3D Reconstruction and Novel View Synthesis. I'm open to research discussions and project collaborations, please feel free to get in touch!

During 2020 to 2022, I participated in the double-diploma program between SPEIT and [École Nationale Supérieure de Techniques Avancées (ENSTA)](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/en), France, and received an Engineering degree from ENSTA.

In my leisure hours, I indulge in sports like basketball, badminton, and fitness, showcasing my passion for an active lifestyle. Additionally, I possess proficiency in chinese calligraphy.
